INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN THIS PROJECT

I have used Sqlite3 as my database
Run login.html to run the application after running the backend
Github shows authentication page when not already authenticated/logged in
I have used my client_Id so user must change it with theirs for the application to run
Node_modules folder is ignored by git_ignore and hence, is not present in the repository, it can be installed using npm install function
I have made a video showing all features of the application, the drive link for the same is - https://drive.google.com/file/d/19zefm-oBJy3Y_QFzUkfqgeNjOH53jKYv/view?usp=sharing

IMPORTANT TIMESTAMPS - 
I have shown the login/authentication process 5:00 onwards
Before that, I have explained both functioning of the application and its different components, along with console.log() in VS Code
